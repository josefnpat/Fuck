The purpose of "fuck" is to provide a programming language to insult people,
but still allow the reciepient to decipher what you're really trying to say, conditionally even.

var name .. the index on the var table
data .. simple string that holds data.
label name .. the index on the label table

fuck (table_init) <var name>
fucking (table_set) <var name> <data>
fucked (table_mod) <var name1> <var name2> -- Strings: concat varname1.varname2. Numbers: varname1+(varname2)
unfucking (table_input) <var name> -- read input from keyboard and store into <var name>
unfucked (table_output) <var name> -- write <var name> to stdout
motherfuck (label_define) <label name> -- defines a label. uses PC to determine location
motherfucking (label_jump) <label name> -- jumps to a given label
motherfucked (label_branch) <var name> <label name> -- jump to label 1 if variable evaluates true.

Todo:
  Comments are however you want them: Just don't use the word fuck.
  fuck you reads first words until it finds a command, and then a operand (unless it's table set or the table_input)
