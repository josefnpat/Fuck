The purpose of "Fuck" is to provide a programming language to insult people,
but still allow the reciepient to decipher what you're really trying to say.

Fuck reads every word until it finds a valid command.
Once it has a command it will read until it finds a valid argument type (var|label|raw)
Types:
  <var>   .. A variable as defined with fuck (table_init)
  <raw>   .. A series of characters without a space
  <label> .. A label defined with motherfuck (label_define)
